# html5-portfolio
A simple HTML5 portfolio showcasing two HTML exercises completed as part of the "Become a Full-Stack Web Developer with Just ONE Course" on Udemy. This project demonstrates essential HTML syntax, including headers, anchor tags, image tags, and paragraphs. It also covers basic markup structure such as <!DOCTYPE>, <html>, <head>, and <body>. Additionally, while not required, I incorporated semantic HTML5 tags like <header>, <main>, <section>, and <footer> to enhance the code's structure and readability.
